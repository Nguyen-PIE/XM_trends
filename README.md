# first GITHUB Project - Project XMTrends 
This is my first GIT hub process where I will learn basic frontend and backend functions in a price searching API!

Project XMTrends will be a website where the user can input the name of a product and the site will display a line
graph with price trends, with all time highs and lows.

This will require front end code of a website that directs the user with text fields which then goes to the back
end which will communicate with a API to search and compile the trends.

I chose this specifically for tech-ware such as GPUs, keyboards, monitors, headphones.
